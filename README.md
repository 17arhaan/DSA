### Introduction  
This project contains a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms implemented in **C**, **Python**, and **C++**. It is designed for educational purposes, helping learners understand how data structures and algorithms work under the hood across multiple programming languages.  
<br/>

<h3>LeetCode Solutions</h3>  

●  A collection of efficient and well-documented solutions to a wide range of LeetCode problems in **C**, **Python**, and **C++**. These solutions are designed to help you understand different problem-solving techniques and improve your algorithmic skills.  
<br/>  
●  Solutions are organized by their question numbers indicating difficulty (easy, medium, hard) and topic (e.g., arrays, strings, dynamic programming).
